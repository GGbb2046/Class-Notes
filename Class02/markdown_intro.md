# Introduction to Markdown

Most of the material for this course is written in Markdown. Markdown is a simplified means of creating HTML pages (and other documents).

The Markdown language is quite simple and will benefit you to know.

PS: We'll discuss "pull requesting" later, but this allows you to propose an addition and/or correction to an existing repo that you do not own. For this course, if you see a typo, or would like to add to the content, you can set up a pull request with the requested change to the course content.

See the markdown "cheat sheet" for all you'll need to write/edit Markdown files.

## Installing Markdown Addon

VSCode supports creating and viewing Markdown files, but there is a plugin that improves upon this base functionality.

The professor will walk you through how you can install the plugin in VScode.

## Useful online resources

We'll be working through much of the material found in the online book "How to think like a computer scientist."
http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/

Though this has the term "computer scientist" in the title, it's not as technical as a computer science course would be... instead, it provides an excellent gentle introduction to software developing using python.

Other resources include:

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is the most popular site for programmers to share knowledge. You can search for previous questions/answers, or post one yourself. Be sure to be very detailed in any question you post, and include the source code you're having problems with or have a question about.

[Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) has a number of free online courses. They have an introductory Python section that provides an interactive introduction to basic Python.

[Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) available from Python.org is the documentation developed by the core Python team. It contains a wealth of information on Python but serves more as a reference than a tutorial.
