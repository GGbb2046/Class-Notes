## Course Introduction


Upon the successful completion of this course, you will develop a fundamental understanding of application development using the Python language. My focus will be on helping you build the problem-solving skills and critical thinking necessary for 'coding' applications and an understanding of coding as specification. I will also cover related topics such as DevOps (using Git and GitHub) and Bash shell.

This course is a "special topics" course, and as such, there will most likely be typos, errors, and general "hiccups" in the process of delivering this course. The advantage though is that you get access to a new line of instruction being developed here at UT. I welcome "pull requests" to help improve the content (pull requests are a means of proposing edits to a repository on GitHub; something that we will cover later).

```
Please feel free to submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
with any edits/typos you find. We'll cover pull requesting a little later in this course when we cover Git and GitHub usage.

## Course Delivery Format

The course will be "face to face." 

When possible, live demonstration will be favored over slides. All class notes, assignments and tests will be made available via GitHub (more on this later).

We will meet ten times. Each class will promptly start at 5:00 pm and will be completed before 10 pm. You are encouraged to arrive earlier than this (classroom should be open before 4:30) and use this extra time to student/prepare and finalize any work required from the previous class. NOTE: The regular schedule for this class is 4:30 to 10:15.

General format of class (note that duration of lecture may vary):
* 05:00 - 06:45 Lecture and exercises
* 06:45 - 07:00 break
* 07:00 - 08:45 Lecture and exercises
* 08:45 - 10:00 Assignment(s)

All course announcements and grades will be stored using [Blackboard](https://ut.blackboard.com/).

Most lecture material is written in Markdown (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and will be available on our class GitHub repository ('repo' for short - we'll talk more about this later). Lectures will consist of reviewing and discussing the content loaded on GitHub as well as live demonstration. To keep things as flexible as possible, and to address any new topics that come up, the material for each class will be released incrementally (Class02 after Class01, Class03 after Class02, etc.).

In each class, you will have exercises and assignments. 

* **Exercises** are not directly marked (but, your portfolio mark will depend on them) and are used only for you to practice and develop your programming skills. The professor, and other students can help you with exercises -- but, try to do as much of them on your own as you can (Use this as an opportunity to learn to be self-sufficient. If you don't know something, you can look through notes, access websites, official Python documentation, etc. If you get stuck, reach out to the professor.)

* **Assignments** are submitted and marked. This must be your independent work; therefore, you can't ask for help from the professor or classmates.

## Syllabus

The syllabus for this course is available [here](!insert link to syllabus on GitHub!>.

Please note that this syllabus is subject to change. I will announce any updates via a Blackboard announcement.

## Submitting assignments and tests

Each student will be assigned a [private repo](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/87577/whats-the-benefit-of-having-a-private-repository-for-personal-projects)
on GitHub (note: Git and GitHub will be topics covered in Class#1 of the course).

You can find your assigned repo name [here](https://github.com/itm695x-m19/ClassNotes/blob/master/classlist.csv). Early in the course (1st of 2nd class) the professor will walk through the setup of Git/GitHub and invite you to your private repo.

## Our focus for this course

This course will help you build skills and knowledge in each of the following areas:

* Tools used in programming (IDE, Git/GitHub, etc.)
* Programming concepts (structured programming, classes, iteration, etc.)
* Problem-solving (this is a BIG part of programming, and this course will help you further enhance and develop your problem-solving skills)

## Tools we will use

To be a competent programmer, you need to not only know a programming language but also be fluent in the use of various tools to support the development process. We will focus on the mechanisms of "Social Coding."

* Git and GitHub
* VSCode
* Python/Anaconda (and relevant libraries)
* Jupyter notebooks (no, that's not a typo)
* Static analysis (and secure programming)

## Expectations

We will solve application development problems in Python. I do not expect you to have previous programming experience, but I assume that you have had a basic understanding of how to get around a computer (file folders, copying, install/ uninstall programs, etc.).

There are three general areas of learning to apply a programming language to business:

* Syntax: These are the rules (similar to grammar and punctuation in "natural languages" that we use for everyday communication) that you need to know to "speak" the language.

* Constructs/Concepts: Concepts such as Classes and Objects, statements, expressions, etc. These represent the structure of your communication to the computer. They allow to repeat instructions (looping), jump to reusable sections of code (methods), encapsulate and organize your code into classes, and use objects from these classes.

* Problem-solving. In Business Programming, you are intensely solution focused. Your program (or "code") is used to accomplish a task, to get work done, create new value, and - in general - make a valuable contribution to your organization. Knowing language syntax, programming concepts, and tools is not enough - you need to immerse yourself the practice of developing code that responds to problems, requirements, and a myriad of other influences that define success.

Programming, like driving a car, learning to ride a bike or ice skating â€“ these skills can't be learned from a book alone. You need to practice and experience programming to develop sufficient skill and competence. During this course, we will balance learning new concepts (the lecture portion of our class time) and practice these concepts in exercises, and solve problems using these concepts in assignments.


We have much material to cover in ten classes. You will need to develop study and notetaking strategies that effectively manage your learning of the content. That being said, I'll also try to contain all required coursework to the allotted class time. Therefore, each class will end with 1 to 2 hours to practice, review content, and work on any assignments or quizzes.

### What I expect from you
* Arrive on time.
    * Arriving late is not only disruptive to the class, but it also puts you at a disadvantage as you may miss essential concepts covered during class.
* Be a positive influence on the classroom environment.
    * Learning application development can be at times frustrating. It's vital that you maintain a positive attitude and be willing to overcome any obstacles.

### What you should expect from me

* Though my feedback on assignments may be brief (don't be offended by this), I will be constructive in my marking so that you understand the areas in which you need to put more.
* I will provide timely feedback, most of which will be provided before the start of next class.
* I will treat every student with respect (and I expect the same from you).
* I tend to try to keep the classroom atmosphere "lite," and may be prone to humor, etc. to do so. I'd encourage students to do the same while maintaining focus on the work at hand, and being respectful of everyone in the class.
